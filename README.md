#### dotk

Learning to program in Rust by making myself a Linux CLI tool to help manage dotfiles and configurations. 

There are many other tools to manage dotfiles that work just fine. For now, this is intended to be just for my own learning / use and not a general dotfiles management utility. If I enjoy working on it and get good use out of it, I may rethink this later.
